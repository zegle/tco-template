                Turbo Charged Outfitters specializes in unique aerodynamic parts for multiple makes and brands of vehicles. What makes our
            company special is we offer lightweight aluminum composite material that is much more durable and sturdy than the typical
            fiberglass material most other companies use. With our product you do not need to worry about scratching your aero easily
            as our product is powder coated in a 3 stage process making the surface very durable to weather and road elements. You also
            do not need to worry about scrapping or rocks destroying the splitter like you would with the similar fiberglass aero. Our
            aluminum technology makes it so your aero parts can take a serious beating.
